Installation

Prerequisites: Python 3.5 or later.

It is recommended to install the most recent **stable** release of PyADT from PyPI.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U PyADT


Alternatively, you could install from source code. This will give you the **latest**, but unstable, version of PyADT.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/larryshaw0079/PyADT
