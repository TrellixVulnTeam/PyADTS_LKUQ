# Anomaly Detection for Time-series (PyADT)

`PyADT` is aimed at accelerating the workflow of time series anomaly detection for researchers. It contains various utilities for data loading, pre-processing, detector construction, detector ensemble, evaluation and etc. `PyADT` can help you to write less boilerplate on following parts:

- Preparing dataset & pre-processing
- Feature extraction (Optional)
- Model training
- Ensemble (Optional)
- Evaluation

## Installation
To install the package locally, run:

```bash
cd <pyadt_dir>
pip install .
```
